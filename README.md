# Camptown

A simple, accessibility-minded, semantic-HTML-based audio player for embedding albums into webpages. The player has the following features:

* Embed it with any ordinary `<iframe>`, e.g.:

    ```html
    <iframe src="https://example.com/player-embed/index.html"></iframe>
    ```

* Add one of `#compact`, `#playeronly`, `#notracklist`, or `#albumart` to choose a different layout for the embed, e.g.:

    ```html
    <iframe src="https://example.com/player-embed/index.html#compact"></iframe>
    ```

This is just the player template and a Python wrapper. If you want a fully-fledged editor, check out [Bandcrash](https://fluffy.itch.io/bandcrash).
