Camptown
========

Camptown is an embeddable audio player that tries to provide accessible controls, native playback options, and a usable, compact interface.

If you're looking for something that can generate this player while also encoding your audio for it, check out `Bandcrash <https://fluffy.itch.io/bandcrash>`_.

The package consists of some Jinja templates and a Python module that can process them.
